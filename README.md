Basic components like logic switches, resistors, and probes.

# Addition mode(M=0)
We can add to IC7483, We gave inputs A and B, and the output is collected at 15,2,6,9 pins. The output carry is at 14 pins.
Since the mode (M) is 0, the XOR gates (IC7486) pass the B inputs unaltered to the IC7483.
Normal addition takes place as S=A+B.
# Subtraction mode(M=1)
The binary number A is fed directly into the IC7483, while the binary number B is processed through XOR gates. The XOR gates invert each bit of B (producing B' when M = 1.)
the carry-in of IC7483 is 1, then adding 1 to the inverted B.
this process forms the 2's complement and then performs addition A+(B'+1)=A-B

# simulation results :

# addition of two numbers:
keeping M=0, the addition of two numbers can be done.

# subtraction of two numbers :
keeping M=1, subtraction can be done by making 2's complement method.
